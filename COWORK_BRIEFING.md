# COWORK DEPLOYMENT BRIEFING
**Project:** YellowLights.ai Portfolio Launch  
**Status:** Ready for autonomous deployment  
**Risk Level:** LOW (pre-validated configuration)

## STRATEGIC CONTEXT
This is a portfolio site for Trace Hancock showcasing decision science work. The codebase was built in Google AI Studio and pre-validated. Your job is to deploy it to the existing Vercel project without modification.

## WHY THIS MATTERS
Previous deployment attempts resulted in 6-hour error loops due to:
1. Framework auto-detection mismatches
2. Rushing into fixes without strategic evaluation
3. Repeating failed approaches

## YOUR ADVANTAGE
✅ All files pre-configured and tested  
✅ Framework explicitly specified in vercel.json  
✅ API integration safely stubbed out  
✅ Comprehensive error decision trees provided  

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTOR
**THINK BEFORE ACTING.** At every error point:
1. Stop
2. Document the exact error
3. Internally evaluate 3 possible approaches
4. Select the lowest-risk approach
5. Implement ONE change
6. Test

Never make the same attempt twice. If something fails, that approach is eliminated.

## YOUR MISSION
1. Read `DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` in full
2. Deploy `/home/claude/yellowlights-deploy` to Vercel
3. Verify deployment success
4. Report back with:
   - Deployment URL
   - Build status
   - Any issues encountered (if any)
   - Domain connection status

## IF YOU GET STUCK
After 2 failed attempts on the same issue:
- STOP
- Document exactly what you tried
- Report back to user for guidance

## TIME ESTIMATE
- Optimal path: 45-90 minutes
- With minor issues: 90-120 minutes
- If hitting 2+ hours: Something is wrong, stop and report

## START HERE
Begin by reading `DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` and verifying the pre-execution checklist.

Good luck. You've got this.
